      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be where I have most of the text required for my website. 
        It will be an about me page that will have some of my interests and strengths. 
        I am still not sure how deep to go with this page and how much detail to include.
        I can also include links to all of my social medias on this page of my site.

      </ul>
      <h3>Resume and Accolades</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the page of my site that will house and showcase, as the title describes, both my resume and any and all special awards, certificates, and achievements that I think would benefit me from an employers point of view.
        I will need to keep this page updated more than the other two because this will be the site that will go to highlight me and hopefully make me standout to others.
        It will be something small that will hopefully matter if it ever comes down to me and another person when being considered for a position at a company.
